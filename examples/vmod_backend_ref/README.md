# Varnish Module (VMOD) `backend_ref`

Parse files into numbers

This is a simple example of how to handle errors in a Varnish VMOD.
All three functions will do the same thing: read a file and try to parse its content into a `VCL_INT`.
However, they will handle failure (file not found, permission issue, unparsable content, etc.) differently.

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import backend_ref;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import backend_ref from "path/to/libbackend_ref.so";
```

### Constructor `backend_ref.new([BACKEND backend_arg])`

#### Method `STRING <object>.name()`

#### Method `BOOL <object>.healthy()`

#### Method `BACKEND <object>.backend()`
