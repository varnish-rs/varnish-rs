# Varnish Module (VMOD) `timestamp`

Measure time in VCL

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import timestamp;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import timestamp from "path/to/libtimestamp.so";
```

### Function `TIME timestamp.now()`

Just return the current system time. This will actually return different values if called
multiple times in the same VCL subroutine, contrary to the `now` keyword that always has
the same value for a give subroutine.

### Function `TIME timestamp.add_duration(TIME time, DURATION duration)`

Add `time` and `duration` and return the resulting time

### Function `DURATION timestamp.timestamp()`

Returns the duration since the same function was called for the last time (in the same task).
If it's the first time it's been called, return 0.

There could be only one type of per-task shared context data type in a Varnish VMOD.
